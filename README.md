# ascii-art-generator

Uses python to generate a simple ASCII art.

The best way to view it is with a dark background, and a somewhat small text font like 11px or 12px. I recommnend Notepad++, Obsidian theme and zoomed out to the max. The program may take a while to compile an image if it is big, so be patient. The one I have tested of doge, of 480 by 300 was very quick. However, a much bigger photo took a lot longer.

When it comes to options, the software will ask you two things: Where is the photo and where do you want to write the text file?
-The first one should be in the format of:    C:\Users\black\Videos\Captures\picture.png    or just picture.png if its located in the same folder
-The second option can also be in a simlar format, but is more forgiving as it only prints to .txt . It should automatically add .txt if you forget.

Finally, there is a high chance of bugs as I literally made this in like 30 minutes so be wary. Hope you enjoy and find use out of it!
